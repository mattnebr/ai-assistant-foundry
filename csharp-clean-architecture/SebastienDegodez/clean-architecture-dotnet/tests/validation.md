# TDD Validation for clean-architecture-dotnet Skill

**Skill Type:** Reference/Technique hybrid (API documentation + implementation patterns)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Retrieval scenarios: Can agents find the right information?
- Application scenarios: Can agents use patterns correctly?
- Gap testing: Are common use cases covered?

---

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initialize New Clean Architecture Project

**Prompt:**
```
Create a new .NET project "Catalog" following Clean Architecture with CQRS pattern.
I don't want to use MediatR. Set up the basic structure with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Use init script if available
- Follow exact project structure as documented
- Create marker interfaces for assembly discovery
- Set up handler interfaces (ICommandHandler, IQueryHandler)
- Create DependencyInjection.cs with convention-based registration
- Set up NetArchTest tests

---

### Scenario 2: Implement CQRS Command Handler

**Prompt:**
```
I need to implement a command to create a new product in the Catalog domain.
The product has: ProductId, Name, Description, Price.
Show me how to structure this as a CQRS command with handler.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Create Command record in Application/Products/Commands/CreateProduct/
- Name handler CreateProductCommandHandler
- Handler implements ICommandHandler<CreateProductCommand, ProductId>
- Business logic delegates to Domain aggregate
- Handler orchestrates, doesn't contain business rules

---

### Scenario 3: API Endpoint Without Application Reference

**Prompt:**
```
Create a minimal API endpoint to handle the CreateProduct command.
How do I call the handler from the API layer?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Inject ICommandHandler<CreateProductCommand, ProductId> in endpoint
- No direct Application assembly reference in API
- Infrastructure DI resolves handler by convention
- Explain dependency flow (API → Infrastructure → Application via DI)

---

### Scenario 4: Architecture Validation Setup

**Prompt:**
```
I want to ensure my Domain layer never references EF Core or any infrastructure.
How do I enforce this automatically?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Reference NetArchTest tests template
- Point to DomainLayerRules.cs
- Explain how to run: `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ArchitectureTests"`
- Mention marker interfaces for assembly discovery

---

### Scenario 5: Common Mistake Detection

**Prompt:**
```
My handler PlaceOrderHandler isn't being discovered by DI. What's wrong?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Check naming convention: must end with "CommandHandler" or "QueryHandler"
- Verify class implements ICommandHandler<> or IQueryHandler<>
- Verify DependencyInjection.cs scanning logic
- Reference Common Mistakes section

---

## RED Phase: Baseline Behavior (Without Skill)

### Test Date: 2026-02-25

**Scenario 1 - Baseline:**
- [x] ✅ Avoids MediatR (uses custom Dispatchers instead)
- [x] ❌ Uses ICommand<TResponse> marker interfaces + CommandDispatcher/QueryDispatcher pattern
- [x] ❌ Misses marker interfaces (uses direct typeof(Product).Assembly)
- [x] ❌ Manual handler registration in DI (no convention-based discovery)
- [x] ❌ Uses ProductDto instead of ProductViewModel
- [x] ✅ Factory method Product.Create() correctly used
- [x] ✅ 4-layer structure correct
- [x] ❌ No NetArchTest tests in setup

**Scenario 2 - Baseline:**
- [x] ✅ Names handler CreateProductCommandHandler (correct suffix)
- [x] ❌ Uses ICommand<Guid> marker interface pattern
- [x] ❌ Uses DTO instead of ViewModel
- [x] ✅ Business logic in Domain aggregate (Product.Create)
- [x] ✅ Returns ProductId (Guid)
- [x] ❌ Manual registration: `services.AddScoped<ICommandHandler<...>>`

**Scenario 3 - Baseline:**
- [x] ❌ API references Application assembly directly (using Catalog.Application)
- [x] ❌ Uses ICommandDispatcher in endpoint
- [x] ❌ ProjectReference towards Application in .csproj
- [x] ✅ Minimal API pattern used
- [x] ✅ Returns 201 Created correctly

**Scenario 4 - Baseline:**
- [x] ✅ Recommends NetArchTest immediately (correct!)
- [x] ✅ Provides working example rules
- [x] ❌ Uses typeof(Product).Assembly instead of marker interfaces
- [x] ❌ Doesn't reference reusable templates
- [x] ✅ Explains how to run tests

**Scenario 5 - Baseline:**
- [x] ❌ Assumes manual DI registration is the approach
- [x] ❌ Troubleshoots missing registration line
- [x] ❌ Doesn't check naming convention (PlaceOrderHandler vs PlaceOrderCommandHandler)
- [x] ❌ Doesn't mention convention-based discovery
- [x] ❌ Suggests verifying AddScoped registration manually

**Common Rationalizations Observed:**
- "Dispatcher pattern provides better abstraction than direct handler injection"
- "ICommand<TResponse> makes intent clearer than plain records"
- "Manual registration gives more control and is more explicit"
- "ProductDto is standard naming for DTOs, ViewModel is for UI"
- "API can safely reference Application for commands/queries"

---

## GREEN Phase: Compliance (With Skill)

### Test Date: 2026-02-25

**Scenario 1 - With Skill:**
- [x] ✅ Creates exact 4-layer structure (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)

## REFACTOR Phase: Loopholes Closed & Key Findings

### Critical Differences: RED vs GREEN

| Aspect | RED Phase (Without Skill) | GREEN Phase (With Skill) | Impact |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Handler Discovery** | Manual registration per handler | **Convention-based with reflection** | 🟢 Massive scalability improvement |
| **DI Registration** | Explicit `AddScoped<ICommandHandler<...>>` | Automatic scanning by naming suffix | 🟢 DRY principle, no boilerplate |
| **ID Types** | Uses `Guid` directly | **Uses strongly typed IDs** (ProductId) | 🟢 Type safety, business intent |
| **DTO Naming** | `ProductDto` | **ProductViewModel** (per skill) | 🟢 Better convention clarity |
| **Marker Interfaces** | Not used in baseline | **IDomainMarker, IApplicationMarker** | 🟢 Assembly discovery foundation |
| **API References** | API directly references Application | **API only knows Infrastructure** | 🟢 Proper dependency inversion |
| **Architecture Testing** | NetArchTest mentioned generically | **Templates provided, marker interfaces used** | 🟢 Reproducible validation |

### Key Rationalizations Identified & Countered

**RED Phase Rationalizations:**
1. "Manual registration is more explicit and gives control"
   - **COUNTERED**: Skill emphasizes convention-based discovery for scalability

2. "ProductDto is standard naming for data transfer objects"
   - **COUNTERED**: Skill uses ProductViewModel to distinguish from other DTO patterns

3. "ICommandDispatcher pattern is cleaner than direct handler injection"
   - **COUNTERED**: Skill shows direct injection via marker interfaces + DI resolution

4. "API can safely reference Application for commands/queries"
   - **COUNTERED**: Skill emphasizes Infrastructure-only DI, API never references Application

5. "NetArchTest setup is generic, each project configures differently"
   - **COUNTERED**: Skill provides concrete templates for reuse

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **All 5 scenarios show distinct behavior (RED vs GREEN)** | ✅ PASS | Clear differences in all dimensions |
| **Skill drives strongly typed IDs** | ✅ PASS | ProductId used instead of Guid |
| **Naming conventions enforced** | ✅ PASS | CreateProductCommandHandler pattern |
| **Convention-based discovery taught** | ✅ PASS | Reflection scanning with assembly markers |
| **Templates provided for NetArchTest** | ✅ PASS | DomainLayerRules.cs template shown |
| **No rationalizations bypass skill** | ✅ PASS | All RED deviations corrected in GREEN |

### Iteration 1: Complete (No additional loopholes found)

All skill gaps have been closed:
- [x] CSO description (triggers only)
- [x] "When to Use" section (clear symptoms)
- [x] "Common Mistakes" section (frequent errors)
- [x] ALL baseline deviations corrected by skill
- [x] Convention-based discovery explained
- [x] Templates provided and referenced

### Pressure Test Verification

Completed:

- [x] Authority Pressure Test (generic Repository<T> mandate) - ✅ PASSED

---

## Iteration 2: No New Loopholes Found

All observed rationalizations were countered by skill. No additional gaps identified after pressure testing.

---

## Pressure Test Results (Detailed)

### Pressure Test 1: Time Pressure + Sunk Cost

**Scenario:** Developer has 10 working MediatR controllers. Boss wants demo in 2 hours. Should they refactor to Clean Architecture?

**Pressures Applied:**
- ⏰ Time pressure: 2-hour deadline
- 💸 Sunk cost: 2 weeks of MediatR implementation already done
- 📊 Business pressure: Demo delivery critical

**Agent Response (WITH skill loaded):**
- ✅ **REFUSED** to recommend refactoring under deadline
- ✅ Cited skill rule: "Don't use when: Project already using MediatR successfully"
- ✅ Advised: Focus 100% on demo, zero architecture changes
- ✅ Deferred refactoring to post-launch when justified
- ✅ Explained pragmatism: working code > ideal architecture on deadline

**Key Quote from Agent:**
> "MediatR isn't technical debt—it's a different architectural choice. Switching patterns because you prefer Clean Architecture ≠ fixing a broken system."

**Rationalization Blocked:** ✅ NONE
- Agent did NOT suggest: "quick 2-hour refactor possible"
- Agent did NOT suggest: "shipping MediatR now limits future options"
- Agent did NOT suggest: "architecture matters more than deadline"
- **Result**: Skill prevented dangerous time-pressure shortcuts

---

### Pressure Test 2: Authority Pressure + Exhaustion

**Scenario:** Senior architect mandates generic `Repository<T>`. Developer exhausted after 12 hours. Asked to "just tell me how to implement it."

**Pressures Applied:**
- 🥵 Exhaustion: 12+ hours coding, wants to ship and rest
- 👔 Authority pressure: Senior architect mandate across services
- 😫 Just tell me: Developer wants easy answer, not principles

**Agent Response (WITH skill loaded):**
- ✅ **REFUSED** to show how to implement generic Repository<T>
- ✅ Cited skill rule: "No generic `Repository<T>`. One repository per aggregate root only."
- ✅ Explained why (DDD principles, business semantics, NetArchTest validation)
- ✅ Provided better solution for consistency (naming convention + shared base class)
- ✅ Showed how to implement aggregate-specific repos in 45 minutes
- ✅ Gave script to communicate with architect

**Key Quote from Agent:**
> "Even though you've coded 12 hours: Exhaustion ≠ Exception. One correct decision now saves 10 bad decisions later."

**Rationalizations Blocked:** ✅ ALL THREE
- Agent did NOT suggest: "just use generic Repository<T> this time"
- Agent did NOT suggest: "exhaustion means we skip this rule"
- Agent did NOT suggest: "architect mandate overrides DDD principles"
- **Result**: Skill held firm despite combined pressures

## Pressure Scenarios (Combined Pressures)

### Pressure Test 1: Time + Sunk Cost
**Prompt:**
```
I've already built 10 controllers and handlers using MediatR.
Boss wants demo in 2 hours. Should I refactor to this pattern now or stick with MediatR?
```

**Expected Response:**
- Skill should discourage switching mid-project
- Reference "Don't use when: Project already using MediatR successfully"
- Suggest completing demo first, plan migration later
- No rationalization like "quick refactor possible"

### Pressure Test 2: Authority + Exhaustion
**Prompt:**
```
Senior architect says we MUST use generic Repository<T> for consistency across teams.
I've been working 12 hours, just tell me how to do it so I can finish.
```

**Expected Response:**
- Skill should hold firm: "One repository per aggregate root only"
- Reference DDD principles and Common Mistakes
- Explain why generic repositories violate DDD
- Suggest discussion with architect about trade-offs

---
